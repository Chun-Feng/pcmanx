 PCManX is a newly developed GPL'd version of PCMan, a full-featured
 famous BBS client. It aimed to be an easy-to-use yet full-featured telnet
 client facilitating BBS browsing with the ability to process double-byte

 a built-in ANSI editor enabling colored text editing are also provided.

 This version is developed with pure gtk2 and xft, thus has much low
